# Reinforcement Learning for Lunar Lander

Welcome to the Lunar Lander project! This repository demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning to solve the Lunar Lander challenge using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenAI Gym.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Train an AI model to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon in the LunarLander-v2 environment.
- **Tools:** Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for neural network implementation.
- **Implementation:** The reinforcement learning algorithm is applied, optimizing the model's actions through an epsilon-greedy strategy.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    Python 3.7+
    OpenAI Gym
    NumPy
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    Other libraries
   
3. Run the training script: `test.py`

## Results

The trained model consistently achieves successful landings, showcasing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in mastering complex tasks.

## Next Steps

Explore more challenges, fine-tune hyperparameters, and adapt the model for diverse environments.

Feel free to contribute and expand the capabilities of the model!

Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸŒ•
